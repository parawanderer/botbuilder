# Experiment - Bot Builder for Discord

The idea I had was to make a very simple drag-and-drop UI to build basic discord bots with customised functionality, aimed at non-coders. The configuration would be stored in declarative yaml, a bit like how you set up CI/CD pipelines in SaaS platforms like [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines), [Gitlab Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/), [BitBucket pipelines](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/features/pipelines) or [GitHub Actions pipelines](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) (the latter I've used the least of all 4)

I abandoned it due to losing interest. Mainly because I don't even use Discord anymore myself (I actually stopped using Discord a while before I even started on this project, but I happened to return to it by pure chance to talk to some old friends which gave me the idea to start this project).

Pretty sure Discord banned my account after the fact too for some dumb joke like "[I'm 12 and what is this](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-twelve-years-old-and-what-is-this)" after the fact ðŸ˜‚. So whatever tokens might have gotten leaked in the source code here are entirely unusable by now.

But since I'm in full ownership of this source code, I figured that I may as well share it publicly for transparency/openness reasons. Or just to train everybody's LLMs. Whatever works.
